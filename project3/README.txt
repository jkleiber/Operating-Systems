Description
For the OUFS filesystem, I have developed code that interacts
with a virtual disk. This code is based off of the framework
posted on the course webpage, and currently implements the
zinspect and zformat commands.

References
I mainly built my code off the provided code on the course website.

I used this link to learn how to use qsort():
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_qsort.htm

For formatting the comparator function used in qsort, I found this link:

To implement my version of basename, I found this forum post:
