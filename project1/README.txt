In general, I leaned on the man pages, lecture notes, and given code for help 
on this assignment. When I didn't know how to do something, I searched online,
and those links are below.

In the past when I wanted to copy strings, I've used strcpy. I referenced man
pages for this, but it was interesting to learn the differences between strcpy
and strdup here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14020380/strcpy-vs-strdup

I used the Open Group's website to learn how to implement putenv()
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604599/functions/putenv.html

Learning how to add errno to the code:
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html

Printing errno in human readable form:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/503878/how-to-know-what-the-errno-means

I used this as a reference when using fopen to read and write:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_fopen.htm

Found this after searching how to remove files in C:
https://linux.die.net/man/3/remove

I wanted to know how to take a substring of a character sequence in C, and this 
helped me:
https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/extract-substring-from-string-in-c-432620/

For detecting if stdin was from a terminal or a redirection, I found this link: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26747597/perform-action-if-input-is-redirected

To find the current working directory, I found this documentation:
